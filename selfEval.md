# Self Evaluation

- **What did you struggle with in this section?**

I struggled with learning to put objects into an array. Using objects and making them print out onto a Terminal was easier. I also have less trouble with using arrays, but attempting to combine these two components of Javascript syntax was more challenging.

- **How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?**

I usually take notes when I think it's about something that I can reference back to at a later time. An example of when I would take notes would be when I'm trying to learn new commands. I probably want to reference commands again in the future so it's helpful to have a sheet of that around.

- **What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?**

 I, admittedly, lean more into Googling first as soon as I feel that I can't solve a problem immediately. However, I hope to try to start giving more time in solving a problem and turn that into a habit.
